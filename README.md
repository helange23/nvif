# Neural Variational Filtering and Inference
This repository contains an efficient approximate algorithm for inference and learning for temporal graphical models with binary latent variables.
This code is accompanied by the following [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8683552).

# Usage
In order to use the algorithm, the probability densities for p(z_t | z_{t-1}) and p(x_t | z_t) need to be defined. See nilm_example.py for an example of how to use the algorithm. This readme file will be expanded soon.
